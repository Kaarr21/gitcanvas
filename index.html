        Hello, my name is Nancy Wanjiku Karoki. I am 20 years old living in Nairobi, Kenya. Currently, I am a student at Moringa School studying to become a Full-stack Software Engineer.
        Though I am still a student, I have valuable experience in various coding languages, computer networks and IT support.

        This portfolio, however, is simply meant to showcase the knowledge that I have so far acquired from my Technical Mentor here at Moringa.
